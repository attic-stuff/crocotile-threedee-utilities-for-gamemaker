# some utility functions to help load crocotile3d obj files into gamemaker

these are the functions i use when i am making tools like level editors and model viewers. these functions generally are not optimized or ready to be used "in production" because they are for making things that help you make your game. will be adding more as time marches on, i imagine!

this repo also has a passthru shader to match a basic vertex format.
